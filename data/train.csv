"Germany!

Just the person I want to speak with. I have a somewhat crazy idea that I‚Äôve always wanted to try with I/G, but I‚Äôve never actually convinced the other guy to try it. And, what‚Äôs worse, it might make you suspicious of me. 

So...do I suggest it?

I‚Äôm thinking that this is a low stakes game, not a tournament or anything, and an interesting and unusual move set might make it more fun? That‚Äôs my hope anyway.

What is your appetite like for unusual and crazy?",True,True,italy,germany,74,0,Spring,1901,3,0,"italy, germany",1

"Yeah, I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve tried it and it works, cause I‚Äôve never tried it or seen it. But how I think it would work is (a) my Spring move looks like an attack on Austria, so it would not be surprising if you did not cover Munich. Then (b) you build two armies, which looks like we‚Äôre really at war and you‚Äôre going to eject me. Then we launch the attack in Spring. So there is really no part of this that would raise alarm bells with France.

All that said, I‚Äôve literally never done it before, and it does involve risk for you, so I‚Äôm not offended or concerned if it‚Äôs just not for you. I‚Äôm happy to play more conventionally too. Up to you.",True,NOANNOTATION,italy,germany,89,4,Spring,1901,3,0,"italy, germany",1

I understand your desire to watch behavior before committing to anything. I, personally, am a partner player. I look carefully early in the game for a small group to work with, and then I value loyalty and collaboration. I like to work closely with a tight-knit alliance. 

If you prefer to hop and back and forth, or play more of an individual game, then we might not be a good match.

"Hi France!

Well, I generally don‚Äôt like to play as Italy at all, frankly. But when I do, I go east. Not sure whether I‚Äôll head towards Turkey or Austria, but I think the one big advantage that you and I both have is that we have a mutual border that is easy to keep clear. 

I‚Äôm not moving west. It takes forever to get there, and there are rarely centers there for me when I arrive. I hope you feel the same way about moving towards me. 

I‚Äôd like to keep our border clear and I‚Äôd like to act as ‚Äútrio wires‚Äù for each other. Basically, if either Germany or England want to attack you, I expect they‚Äôll mention something to me, and if you‚Äôll look out for me diplomatically, I‚Äôll give you a head‚Äôs up if ever you need to worry. 

How do you like to play France?",False,True,italy,france,84,1,Spring,1901,3,0,"italy, france",1

I'd love to be trio wires. I've heard from everyone in the east, but not much substance, which probably means a bunch of passive openings.  If there's little fighting between the Eastern powers it might make it tougher for us, so hopefully things will shake up a bit in that department.

Guten Tag! Wanted to touch base about your plans for this year.,True,True,england,germany,24,0,Spring,1901,3,0,"germany, england",1
"your destruction, mostly. but plans can change",True,True,germany,england,49,1,Spring,1901,3,0,"germany, england",1
Nobody makes it far without friends in this game. I suppose you're hoping to be friends with France then?,True,True,england,germany,53,2,Spring,1901,3,0,"germany, england",1
"I don't consider it wise to put stock in any friendship until it's proven. However, I tend to trust people more if they are willing to give me some information before asking it from me",True,True,germany,england,59,3,Spring,1901,3,0,"germany, england",1
"Well, that makes two of us then. You're welcome to ask a specific question if you have one though.",True,True,england,germany,60,4,Spring,1901,3,0,"germany, england",1
Alright then. What are your plans for the North Sea these days?,True,NOANNOTATION,germany,england,78,5,Spring,1901,3,0,"germany, england",1
I'll be moving there this spring. Just doing a pretty standard northern opening. You taking the fleet to Holland or Denmark (or somewhere else)?,True,True,england,germany,79,6,Spring,1901,3,0,"germany, england",1
My fleet is Holland-bound. Pleasure doing business üòÉ,True,True,germany,england,83,7,Spring,1901,3,0,"germany, england",1
"Alright, thanks for letting me know. I'd also like to talk about me going to Belgium. I imagine this is something a bit less amenable to you, but maybe something we could bargain over?",True,True,england,germany,88,8,Spring,1901,3,0,"germany, england",1
"Well, now the Belgium discussion changes a bit. France has this secured unless we collaborate in opposition. Also, I can prevent your move to Denmark.",True,True,england,germany,172,9,Fall,1901,3,0,"germany, england",1
"I'd be amenable to that. To be clear, Would you want me to move my fleet to Belgium while your North Sea fleet supports?",True,NOANNOTATION,germany,england,173,10,Fall,1901,3,0,"germany, england",1
"So I could do this, but to secure the move you would also have to cut the support from Bur that France will likely give to move Pic to Bel. You can just attack Bur from Mun to do this. Also, providing this support is a bit of a favor and might put me at odds with France. Would you be willing to offer Denmark to sweeten the deal for me?",True,True,england,germany,174,11,Fall,1901,3,0,"germany, england",1
how can you take Denmark while also supporting me from the north sea?,True,True,germany,england,177,12,Fall,1901,3,0,"germany, england",1
Oh I'm talking about next year. Should have clarified. But this would require you keeping out this year.,True,NOANNOTATION,england,germany,182,13,Fall,1901,3,0,"germany, england",1
"I'm sorry, but why? Why couldn't I hold it for this Winter and then dip in the Spring to let you in?",True,True,germany,england,189,14,Fall,1901,3,0,"germany, england",1
"I'd sooner keep Denmark and let you be the one to occupy Belgium, if that's preferable (i.e. support your North sea fleet moving there)",True,True,germany,england,191,15,Fall,1901,3,0,"germany, england",1
The reason is because I'd need your support into denmark to be sure russia couldn't bump me out. And it's putting a lot of trust in you to expect you'll just clear the way for me.,True,True,england,germany,197,16,Fall,1901,3,0,"germany, england",1
"Well so what do you think of my counter offer, then?",True,True,germany,england,204,17,Fall,1901,3,0,"germany, england",1
"I certainly appreciate it. The only issue is that it still doesn't guarantee Belgium for me. France may support Bur from Pic instead, and then it would be a bounce.",True,True,england,germany,205,18,Fall,1901,3,0,"germany, england",1
"I have it on, admittedly, Italian authority that France is trying to make a play for Munich from Burgundy. But even if that weren't the case, vacating burgundy would leave Marseilles vulnerable to me. So I think the only option for France that wouldn't be Pyrrhic is to move from Pic",True,True,germany,england,206,19,Fall,1901,3,0,"germany, england",1
"That's fair. At the least I'd like to keep France out of Belgium, even if I don't end up with it.",True,False,england,germany,207,20,Fall,1901,3,0,"germany, england",1
Also I had to look up Pyrrhic haha,True,True,england,germany,208,21,Fall,1901,3,0,"germany, england",1
"haha -- so, do we have a deal, then? I'll attack Burgundy while supporting your move to belgium, and you'll let me take Denmark this turn?",True,NOANNOTATION,germany,england,209,22,Fall,1901,3,0,"germany, england",1
"Yes, we have a deal.",True,True,england,germany,239,23,Fall,1901,3,0,"germany, england",1
Your holland fleet supports Nth to Bel and I stay out of Denmark this turn.,True,True,england,germany,240,24,Fall,1901,3,0,"germany, england",1
you have a healthy sense of distrust and I respect that. But I appreciate you not trying to keep me out of Denmark nonetheless.,True,True,germany,england,257,25,Winter,1901,5,1,"germany, england",1
"Also, do you have thoughts on how we might collaborate next year? What are your goals, and what are your concerns?",True,True,england,germany,276,26,Winter,1901,4,-1,"germany, england",1
You‚Äôre giving me too much credit. I forgot to click submit on my order for the north sea or something. Was surprised myself to see a hold there. So why did you back out of the deal then?,True,True,england,germany,277,27,Winter,1901,4,-1,"germany, england",1
Preferred to see France there.,True,True,germany,england,279,28,Winter,1901,5,1,"germany, england",1
"I can understand why you might have made that move, but I think it‚Äôs actually bad for both of us. Even if you and France team up to knock me out, france will get the better part of that deal and will then work with Russia to take you down.",True,True,england,germany,281,29,Winter,1901,4,-1,"germany, england",1
"If I work with France, we‚Äôll bring Russia in on it (who needs some help after what happened with Turkey). This looks good for all three of us, and very bad for you.",True,True,england,germany,282,30,Winter,1901,4,-1,"germany, england",1
"The last option is for us to work together against France. On the one hand, this is a good move because France is a strong player in a strong position. On the other hand, how am I supposed to trust you at all to cooperate?",True,True,england,germany,283,31,Winter,1901,4,-1,"germany, england",1
"Real talk: I was given bad information that you and France were working together last round, which does not seem to be the case, but that's why I didn't follow through on our deal. I am well positioned now to take Belgium, and I can see now that, as you say, it would be much easier on me to ally with you rather than try to take you down even with France's help. But I can understand if you don't want to trust me.",True,True,germany,england,284,32,Winter,1901,5,1,"germany, england",1
"I was working with France, and I still have a positive relationship with france. We agreed to stay out of the english channel, and france had agreed to support me into belgium. But this was about hedging my bets, not working against you. And you see how that played out haha.",True,True,england,germany,285,33,Winter,1901,4,-1,"germany, england",1
France would love for me to be an ally in taking you out of the game over the next couple of years. They‚Äôve been talking about convincing russia to help with the takedown.,True,True,england,germany,286,34,Winter,1901,4,-1,"germany, england",1
"A joint stab against france would require a high level of collaboration on our end. Something like an agreement to essentially act as one country up until a certain year. Sharing all planned moves, following up on them etc. So this would be my condition for working together.",True,True,england,germany,295,35,Winter,1901,4,-1,"germany, england",1
"I would be willing to do that, but as I see it, you have no reason to choose France as an ally over me at this point. So, why me?",True,True,germany,england,303,36,Winter,1901,5,1,"germany, england",1
*choose me as an ally over france,True,True,germany,england,306,37,Winter,1901,5,1,"germany, england",1
"So my reasoning is that I think France is a stronger player than either of us, or at least a more engaged one. I'm getting all this tactical analysis and commentary about the state of the whole board and all that. If I help France, France probably beats me. If we defeat France together, I think we each end up with an even fighting chance.",True,True,england,germany,310,38,Winter,1901,4,-1,"germany, england",1
So basically France is too smart to be left alive and the world ought to belong to us idiots üòÇ,True,True,germany,england,315,39,Winter,1901,5,1,"germany, england",1
What about Russia?,True,True,germany,england,316,40,Winter,1901,5,1,"germany, england",1
"Haha yeah that was kind of my thinking. Russia is a little tied up in the south, and so I don't expect aggression in the north. However, france would respond to a stab by begging for Russian (and potentially austrian and italian) assistance. So the choice next year is between containing russia or being aggressive (which would mean going for sweden or St. P). I think the builds we see this winter will make it more clear what's possible.",True,True,england,germany,326,41,Winter,1901,4,-1,"germany, england",1
"Speaking of, what are your planned builds? I'm building a fleet in London.",True,True,england,germany,330,42,Winter,1901,4,-1,"germany, england",1
Armies in Kiel and Munich,True,True,germany,england,333,43,Winter,1901,5,1,"germany, england",1
"What are your plans for your north sea and London fleets?

I'm trying to decide now how best to handle Belgium and that is going to depend on whether France is concerned with defending Brest or if instead they expect help from you in disrupting anything I try to do from Holland. 

...I can offer you support in moving into Sweden in exchange for supporting my Burgundy troops into Belgium? Is that worth more than whatever France might be offering you right now?",True,True,germany,england,343,44,Spring,1902,5,1,"germany, england",1
"Any thoughts on my offer?
I have another proposal if you‚Äôre interested",True,True,germany,england,377,45,Spring,1902,5,1,"germany, england",1
England. You're killin me here.,True,True,germany,england,381,46,Spring,1902,5,1,"germany, england",1
Hey sorry. Busy evening for me. Let me think a second and respond to all this..,True,True,england,germany,382,47,Spring,1902,4,-1,"germany, england",1
"Ok so for one thing France isn't exactly offering me anything, so there's no real comparison of your offer vs theirs.",True,True,england,germany,384,48,Spring,1902,4,-1,"germany, england",1
"My once concern about the full-on france stab would be that the job couldn't be done quickly enough. We could force Bel this year, but we unfortunately wouldn't be able to put France down a unit because Spa is a guarantee for France. This may even allow for a rebuild in Bre if the Belgian army gets dislodged.",True,True,england,germany,385,49,Spring,1902,4,-1,"germany, england",1
That's where my new plan comes in!,True,True,germany,england,386,50,Spring,1902,5,1,"germany, england",1
Ok what's the sitch,True,True,england,germany,387,51,Spring,1902,4,-1,"germany, england",1
"You move fleets to Eng, Ska, and Nth this turn. Italy moves to Pie. I move Hol-Bel, Kie-Ruh, Bur-Gas, Mun-Bur. Now, France might foresee me attempting to take Gas, but more likely they want to dislodge me from Bur. This puts them in a position where they will have to lose one of Paris, Belgium, Marseilles, or Brest, and will not be able to vacate the others for building season.",True,True,germany,england,391,52,Spring,1902,5,1,"germany, england",1
France could stop by bumping Par and Mar in Gas right? And you're suggesting my moves a setup of going against russia?,True,True,england,germany,394,53,Spring,1902,4,-1,"germany, england",1
"Also, have you talked to Italy about this?",True,True,england,germany,397,54,Spring,1902,4,-1,"germany, england",1
"Damn--I didn't think of the bumping. (sorry, this is just my first game and I'm still learning). And yeah I thought you'd want to grab Sweden because why not? 

I haven't discussed the full plan, but they seemed amenable to moving to pie",True,True,germany,england,398,55,Spring,1902,5,1,"germany, england",1
Okay how about this:,True,True,germany,england,400,56,Spring,1902,5,1,"germany, england",1
"Keep your fleets in NWG and NTH, but move to ENG. Have NTH support HOL-BEL. 
I'll attack BUR-PIC, move KIE-RUH, MUN-BUR. If France does a Gascon Bounce, They'll have to lose either Brest or Paris or Marseilles. If they try to dislodge me instead, I'll retreat to Gascony. 
You still get my support to march on Sweden in Fall if desired.",True,True,germany,england,403,57,Spring,1902,5,1,"germany, england",1
Keep in mind that Munich is vulnerable. Italy and Austria may have a deal in the works for that. But this is the sort of plan that I had thought through originally.,True,True,england,germany,404,58,Spring,1902,4,-1,"germany, england",1
This would be a break of my DMZ with France in the channel. Which is why the success of a stab like this is especially important.,True,True,england,germany,405,59,Spring,1902,4,-1,"germany, england",1
"well ya could have saved me some brain cells by sharing it in the first place! üòõ  
And Italy and Austria, unless they're lying, think of me as an ally. That said, my plan doesn't actually involve vacating Munich",True,True,germany,england,406,60,Spring,1902,5,1,"germany, england",1
"Oh fair, because you're not actually moving into Pic, you're just cutting the support. I had you moving from Bur to Bel. Dislodging the French army from Bel could result in a disband. And if we don't get an additional supply center could mean a rebuild in Brest, which would be bad for me (adding Spain is probably a given). Have you considered the potential support of Mar from Spa s.c. ?",True,True,england,germany,407,61,Spring,1902,4,-1,"germany, england",1
"Yeah if my calculations are correct the French home supply centers hold. First move is to bounce in Gas to keep you out, then move spain to s.c. and lose bel. Next move is to support hold in mar from spain s.c. and then bounce paris to brest to keep me out. Bre, Par, and Mar all hold in the fall.",True,True,england,germany,408,62,Spring,1902,4,-1,"germany, england",1
"OK, Marseilles might be a no-go this round then. 

If you don't want a rebuild in Brest, we'll simply attack Picardy and force a retreat to Brest by an army. Not so bad for your fleet, right? I'll move into Paris from BUR",True,True,germany,england,409,63,Spring,1902,5,1,"germany, england",1
"wait I mean A retreat to burgundy by that army. Then the Parisian Army will be in brest, so no rebuild will occur",True,True,germany,england,410,64,Spring,1902,5,1,"germany, england",1
"Well, it kind of becomes rock paper scissors there. If I try to go into Brest it's a bounce and it remains open. If I don't, and France takes the risk of not going (probably won't happen) then it would stay open too.",True,True,england,germany,411,65,Spring,1902,4,-1,"germany, england",1
"Sounds like you'd like the belgian army to disband though. I understand, as it could help somebody out to take munich from Ruh.",True,True,england,germany,412,66,Spring,1902,4,-1,"germany, england",1
"whoa dude I just want a supply center don't go talking about people invading the fatherland

So are you saying no deal, then?",True,True,germany,england,413,67,Spring,1902,5,1,"germany, england",1
"No, I'm just echoing your probable reasoning for wanting the disband of the belgian army rather than its retreat to Ruh.",True,True,england,germany,414,68,Spring,1902,4,-1,"germany, england",1
"I don't see what that has to do with you, though? Like what difference does it make to you whether that army disbands or retreats to Ruh?",True,True,germany,england,415,69,Spring,1902,5,1,"germany, england",1
"The disband allows for a rebuild, if there's an open home supply center and France still has 5 total. So this could mean building a fleet in Brest.",True,True,england,germany,416,70,Spring,1902,4,-1,"germany, england",1
ohhh I see. So what you're saying is you'd accept the deal if I didn't arrange for the disband and allowed a retreat to Ruh?,True,True,germany,england,417,71,Spring,1902,5,1,"germany, england",1
"Let me sleep on it. I may be fine regardless. I'll confirm moves in the morning. But for this plan, Spring looks like your support into Sweden and my support into Belgium. I'll be very curious to see moves from Russia-Italy-Austria. If they all converge in on you, this could be trouble. I doubt that level of collaboration is going to happen though.",True,True,england,germany,418,72,Spring,1902,4,-1,"germany, england",1
hang on would you be willing to postpone your sweden march until Fall? I'm not so keen on forcing Russia into the baltic,True,True,germany,england,419,73,Spring,1902,5,1,"germany, england",1
You'd still hold sweden by winter,True,True,germany,england,420,74,Spring,1902,5,1,"germany, england",1

"This isn‚Äôt a full stab. I‚Äôm sorry for the deception though. I hadn‚Äôt heard whether Italy was anti-French. Now I have. I‚Äôm taking Denmark this year with Russian support. I‚Äôm sorry for that too. Kiel can‚Äôt save it. I‚Äôd suggest you bounce kiel and munich in Ruh and then attack holland from belgium to cut support .

well not really--I just assumed that attacking a convoying fleet would disrupt the convoy and that was apparently wrong,True,True,germany,england,551,83,Winter,1902,4,-1,"germany, england",1
Yeah you have to dislodge. But you held ruhr! And my way wouldn‚Äôt have worked actually. That‚Äôs a stalemate line if you do the same moves except the fleet goes to belgium (i think).

I told France (truthfully) that I couldn't cut your support this turn,True,True,germany,england,742,93,Fall,1903,4,-1,"germany, england",1

If italy agrees, let me know. I'll tell France to put all power into defending Marseilles and Mao. 

The hope is that since last turn *I* was the one who knew Italy's move and this time--as far as Italy knows--only *you'll* know it, Italy won't smell a rat when France is lucky in defending again",True,True,germany,england,1239,217,Fall,1905,5,0,"germany, england",1
No way! I wonder if we've been walking past each other in Iribe and without any idea that we're both in the study. And let's bring up Denmark again when I have another build secured. Who knows how long it will take to get into Brest.,True,True,england,germany,1253,218,Fall,1905,5,0,"germany, england",1
That's a reasonable plan for Italy. Let me get a sense of where Italy's head is at first. He may not even want MAO anymore.,True,True,england,germany,1254,219,Fall,1905,5,0,"germany, england",1
Can you explain the fleet move btw?,True,True,england,germany,1256,220,Fall,1905,5,0,"germany, england",1
"Honestly because I thought you‚Äôd say yes to giving me Denmark.
I doubt we‚Äôve run into each other because I‚Äôm in St Louis for the summer",True,True,germany,england,1257,221,Fall,1905,5,0,"germany, england",1
"Yeah, we should have talked about that  before probably. On its own, the move has a somewhat anti-me connotation. And yeah I definitely have not been to St Louis this summer haha",True,True,england,germany,1258,222,Fall,1905,5,0,"germany, england",1
You're going for Bur this season?,True,NOANNOTATION,england,germany,1259,223,Fall,1905,5,0,"germany, england",1
"Sorry to spook you! And not to beat a dead horse, but: you claim you want to secure another build, but with your denmark fleet basically stuck where it is, it‚Äôs not like keeping it is going to help you with that goal. That supply center‚Äôs doing nothing for you except maintaining the unit bound to it. *I* on the other hand, could help you get what you want by getting another build.

If you have plans to use the denmark fleet, I‚Äôll respect them, because right now our goals are the same. But I see no point in keeping the fleet just for its own sake.

Yep, going for Bur",True,True,germany,england,1264,224,Fall,1905,5,0,"germany, england",1
Yeah I mean it's a bargaining chip. Russia has to be in my good graces while I have it. And it's something I could offer you in exchange for something nice. It's not clear to me why you need it right now. Paris has your name on it. You'll win the eventual for Mar with no trouble.,True,True,england,germany,1265,225,Fall,1905,5,0,"germany, england",1
"Alright, that‚Äôs a valid reason.
I was feeling more urgent about it because I think it‚Äôs paramount that Russia get some aid against Austria.",True,True,germany,england,1268,226,Fall,1905,5,0,"germany, england",1

What's your plan for taking MAO? If you want to move Eng-IRI I will support Nth into the Channel?,True,True,germany,england,1390,231,Spring,1906,5,0,"germany, england",1
"Yeah i was thinking the same actually. Only risk is a bump in IRI i think results in dislodge of the current channel unit. I‚Äôm willing to risk it though. France at this point is likely trying to choose who to annoy the most as he goes down. I have a feeling it will be me, even though i‚Äôm not the one taking his territories so far.

"Patience, my tea-sipping friend üòõ

"ya know, if you'd just let me have Denmark back you could keep Nth *and* get at least one of Nao/Iri/Brest this year.
I can keep talking to France to see where their head's at, but I think a move to Pic is probably not in the cards. If you were to predict it France'd lose Brest!",True,True,germany,england,1399,235,Spring,1906,5,0,"germany, england",1

"Well, I can say definitively at this point that France prefers to mess with Italy over you. Basically they don't want to see Italy totally dominate this game. I encouraged this by saying that Italy's going to try for MAO this turn and they should focus on defending that. 

Wrt the next couple years, my idea is this: it's crucial that you take Mao, and that I take Paris. From here, you and I can work on beating Italy out of the Iberian, such that you end up with Portugal, Marseilles, and Spain and I end up with Brest and Paris (though you can have Brest at first). From here we're well positioned to start hitting Italy on their home turf, esp. if Russia can keep hammering away at Austria",True,False,germany,england,1411,241,Spring,1906,5,0,"germany, england",1
...any thoughts on this?,True,True,germany,england,1424,242,Spring,1906,5,0,"germany, england",1
That all makes sense. Thought I'm a bit surprised that you'd rather have Brest than Mar. What's the reasoning for that preference? And how long would you let me hold onto Brest?,True,True,england,germany,1431,243,Spring,1906,5,0,"germany, england",1
"I figured this split would give you land and sea options for attacking italy and not for attacking me.

have you made a decision yet about what to do about Nth?,True,True,germany,england,1433,245,Spring,1906,5,0,"germany, england",1
I prefer to do the same moves as last time. So Nth would be a hold. I don't think MAO is going to IRI or NAO. But you would have the inside scoop.,True,True,england,germany,1437,246,Spring,1906,5,0,"germany, england",1

"*just holding the channel and convoying to Brest?

And if by ""it"" in ""what would you do with Bel if it was freed up?"", you mean Nth, then probably move it to Pic in case France tries to bounce me out of Paris.

I really am curious about your relationship with France btw. Italy mentioned that you asked him recently whether collaboration with France was ok. But what could that mean unless it was against me?,True,True,england,germany,1453,257,Spring,1906,5,0,"germany, england",1

"Well, no. It's true that I asked Italy about collaborating with France, but only because France wanted us all to be able to talk about its last will and testament together.

Well i‚Äôm glad i asked the follow up question. Did italy agree to being part of this discussion? And how did the discussion turn out. Is France going to take out his anger on me with a final stab? Are you going to help him? And yeah i‚Äôve absolutely been talking up anti-german things to italy.

"Oh italy said ""I don't trust France"" and that was the end of it. So no, there didn't end up being a discussion except me telling France that you're gunning for Brest (which was obvious anyway), and that Italy's shooting for Mao this turn (which may or may not be true--but by this time you and I were strategizing and I wanted to keep France out of our way). 
If france *is* planning to stab you, they're intentionally throwing me off the scent. Which would be surprising but not unheard of. So no, I'm not planning to help in a stab I know nothing about.",False,True,germany,england,1461,264,Spring,1906,5,0,"germany, england",1

"Yeah i believe that. So i guess it‚Äôs just giving italy a hard time then, or maybe some unexpected movement north. Has italy talked to you about attacking me?",True,True,england,germany,1463,266,Spring,1906,5,0,"germany, england",1
Post-france?,True,True,england,germany,1464,267,Spring,1906,5,0,"germany, england",1
Well yeah. In the same convo where they said you were plotting to stab me they gave some reasons why it's better for me to side with them than with you.

My real fear here is that knowing my moves, and with a desperate, jovial England seeking your advice, it would be so easy to just feed England enough info to keep me weak while you chow down on the Island. 

I know this from experience: back when you were doing 50/50 shots in the south of France, I did everything I could to find out what you were planning and feed it to France. This was merely a time-buying measure, since France was outmatched and I would eventually run out of pretenses to extract your move. But I wanted to gain more dots before you took over.

"Hi England,
I know that the last thing I said to you was that a partnership between us wouldn't work out, but I've had a genuine change of heart. The reason for that is that I think Italy is far more duplicitous than any of us ever realized; right now they may be promising you that you'll take centers of mine, and maybe even that you two will share a victory together. This is my guess because these are the promises they made to me not so long ago. But we both need to face facts: Italy has never hesitated to profit from discord between us, and will always aid the weaker of us at the expense of the stronger. 
If you're tired of being manipulated in a game Italy feels they own, I have a proposal that might get us both destroyed, but at least we'll have stuck up for ourselves and perhaps minorly inconvenienced Italy on their path to victory. This proposal involves France, who is more than willing to use their last few turns to fight back against Italy. Trusting them may be a hard sell, but so is trusting me. If I were really trying to trick you, I wouldn't ask something so unreasonable as that you trust us both. But frankly I consider knocking Italy down a peg to be the sole most urgent thing we can do to keep this game viable for any of us. 
My proposal is: NWG-Cly, Nth convoy Hol-Yor, Eng-IRI or Wal, Bel s Bre-Eng, Pic-Bre, Par-Pic, Bur-Par, Mun-Bur (I figure I'm about to lose Mun anyway, and if that happens I'll disband my Hel fleet)
Next year we'll be well-positioned to boot Italy off the island and the iberian. What do you think?",True,False,germany,england,2296,552,Fall,1907,7,2,"germany, england",1
"(this part is not for copy-pasting to Italy) I designed this plan to make it look safe for Italy to convoy Gas-Lvp. I know this is what they'd really like to do. I think we need to do everything we can to try and disrupt this. I know it's a riskier move trying to assist Bre into Mao but I think it's the right one. I also think that for *extra* insurance NWG should poke NAO, because worst-case scenario Italy doesn't try the convoy and moves Nao-Lvp and also moves Mao-Nao to bounce. This guarantees Bre makes it into Mao which strengthens our ability to take the southern holdings, and at worst only sets you back a turn in terms of kicking Italy out of Liverpool. In exchange for doing this riskier move, I agree to convoy to york instead of Edi and give up my build. That part of the fake plan is actually true",True,True,germany,england,2297,553,Fall,1907,7,2,"germany, england",1
Italy is telling me to expect a bounce in Bre. So that‚Äôs not consistent with the convoy idea. Maybe he‚Äôs lying?,True,True,england,germany,2298,554,Fall,1907,5,-2,"germany, england",1

"Italy can't make a bounce if we attack Mao and Gas at the same time, which the real plan has us doing",True,True,germany,england,2301,557,Fall,1907,7,2,"germany, england",1
"That‚Äôs fair, it could be a bounce we expect from you. Keep in mind that the French fleet disbands in the fall, assuming it leaves Bre. So if it gets into MAO, it will then vacate by spring",True,True,england,germany,2302,558,Fall,1907,5,-2,"germany, england",1

"Hmm, i mean if we really think it‚Äôs a convoy, disrupting the convoy is a great option. You‚Äôre saying i support Bre from channel? And let me see how Italy responds to the message",True,True,england,germany,2304,560,Fall,1907,5,-2,"germany, england",1

"You mean to Italy? I do think it's worth it, because Italy will realize that I'll turn to you if I'm no longer allied with him. By reporting the plan, you cement Italy's trust in *you*. If you didn't report the plan, Italy'd suspect you. It also gives Italy a false sense of confidence in what I'll do.

Tentative request: after the stab goes through, do I have your permission to send Italy the quotes from Italy that you've sent me? Italy went to *such lengths* to defend himself and make *me* feel guilty for questioning him, and the sheer hypocrisy of it is so revolting. I want to throw his own betrayal back in his face. I figure he's not going to trust you after the stab anyway.",True,True,germany,england,2314,570,Fall,1907,7,2,"germany, england",1
"furthermore, Italy may respond to my plan by offering *you* moves to counter it, and you can bet that the moves offered will turn to Italy's benefit.

"Oh and one more thing: as long as we think the convoy is the real move, we also know that Spain is gonna support Mao, unless Italy is really really cocky.

Let me know if you take issue with any of these, or if you ever hear back from Italy. 
We have a shot that at least one of these moves will get us somewhere. But I recognize this plan is nowhere near as sure a thing as if you just cooperated with Italy. I want to give you one last chance to back out.",True,True,germany,england,2329,574,Fall,1907,7,2,"germany, england",1

Don't really have much of a plan yet - like you, I generally try not to piss off too many people at the start until I get a feel for the lay of the board, so my general decision at start is really just Mos -> Ukr|StP .

Are you going to do something about Italy at some point? There's no way Italy has your best interests at heart.

I can't hold off Italy for much longer. Italy is going to start exploding in terms of builds very soon and you are going to be taking steps backwards as long as England props up Russia.

Not sure what my game plan is here. Right now I'm working on getting Germany to build a fleet. My theory is that if Germany can pivot towards England then it may be a salvageable game. Eliminating England ASAP and there's a possibility we can end up in a draw once AI tensions build.

Haven't heard from Germany yet. I've been honest with Russia about going north, and Russia has expressed some concerns. Doesn't want me to bring my army to Nwy. So, Belgium may be a home I'm interested in if that's on the table.",True,True,england,france,38,4,Spring,1901,3,0,"england, france",1

"Yes, depending on how the spring plays out I may be in a position to support you into Belgium. I don't think it would be conditional on something you do, but rather if it makes sense given the positions in the Fall. Maybe building an army in London rather than a fleet, which likely compliments your goals anyway given the channel DMZ. I think you are right in that Germany would not want to see you in Belgium. If it will antagonize him anyway, it might make sense for us to launch a full out assault in the Fall (this would probably look like bouncing Holland to weaken the German position).",True,NOANNOTATION,france,england,65,9,Spring,1901,3,0,"england, france",1

"My read: Germany gets a pretty good start, facing only a bit of aggression from you.. Austria and Turkey are likely agreed to stand strong against Russia. However, I think there's a chance that Turkey is sort of overselling their ""opposition"" to Russia moving to Arm. There may be a juggernaut alliance in the works.

You're suggesting I get a fleet in NTH and HEL? I think that's the only way to make that work. I would want no fleet built in Bre and our DMZ extended through at least the end of 1903.

But I don't get why you don't think I've been working with you. You proposed two possibilities: Belgium or Holland/Denmark in 1902.

If Germany makes similar moves to her last turn, we would pop both Kiel and Holland and would guarantee Munich/Berlin for next year.

I honestly don‚Äôt know what the heck France is doing to not even take Spain with their first turn one. That seems like a pretty obvious move. I would like Sweden for another supply center.

Think you have to worry more about England right now. I‚Äôm going to be locked down in the south trying to deal with Turkey. England can eventually take Sweden unless you support me moving there. Then you can block England from getting it and it gives me some life in my fight down south with a new supply center.

Those fleets were mainly meant to defend against a lepanto, and, fate willing, maybe seize the black sea that I naively ceded when I was young and trusting.

I assume you want do dedicate your Nap fleet to snagging Tunis. And does the ""coastal waters"" thing mean you're concerned about the Adriatic? If not, then, what I hoped was that you might be willing to support Bul-Ser while stabbing Albania from the sea. This could set us up to start pushing back on Austria from the South.

I think it's perfectly understandable for Turkey to want to defend against a Lepanto, especially when Italy is sounding cautious and doesn't really have many other options to expand. I've just built a second fleet, but then I think I need that to escape my boot whichever way I'm going. 

I am concerned about the Adriatic, but not sure I'm moving into it this year. I agree with your analysis of Bul (you're GOING to get hit) although it might be hard to bring up a new unit into Bul to replace your army there. Are you hoping to feed F Con to the east coast? You might need an Aegean fleet to force your way up, which should probably be yours unless  you're willing to extend me that much trust this early.

Just that I would ceasefire on our borders so he could focus on Italy,True,True,england,germany,1200,233,Spring,1905,6,-1,"germany, england",3
Nothing beyond that,True,True,england,germany,1201,234,Spring,1905,6,-1,"germany, england",3
I'm inclined to just cooperate with Italy and take him out. That would be one less loose end. If we do that then we would have Italy's and Austria's help to eliminate Turkey,True,True,england,germany,1203,235,Spring,1905,6,-1,"germany, england",3
Also in about one more year it will be time to start insinuating to Italy and Austria  that we will betray each other after turkey is gone,True,True,england,germany,1206,236,Spring,1905,6,-1,"germany, england",3

Since clearly France can't be trusted, and obviously he'll have to come for you at some point to go for the win, maybe a convoy to Belgium is in order?  You can hold StP easily, get 2 builds, prevent France from getting any, and change the balance of power pretty dramatically.

If you really trust France you could also convoy to Holland and take a stab at crippling me permanently - he'll get +1 or +2, you'll get +2.  Though you risk bouncing with France if he gets greedy.  But if he builds, and you see a F Mar, you're in for a rough go.  If it's me, convoy to Belgium is the smarter play.  I don't even see it as a stab on your end - our alliance was three-way, and it is broken.

"(pt 2:)
In either case, it's probably not a great idea to try to force your way into Russia via StP.  You've got it, and can hold it easily - there's a reason it's part of the stalemate lines.  You need to grow as fast as you can, or you're just waiting for a knife.  I was waiting for Turkey to stab Russia to give you an opening.  It didn't come, so I tried to force it and opened myself.  But if Turkey stabs now he'll collapse too quickly for you to get (or at least get with any chance to defend) more than one more center.

I would strongly consider figuring out lines and conditions with Russia so you can both dedicate your forces elsewhere.  And I say that knowing that a highly likely place for Russia to dedicate forces is at me.  But since the second most likely (and possibly first) is at Turkey, which takes a partner from France, it's worth the risk.

And I say that knowing that a highly likely place for Russia to dedicate forces is at me.  But since the second most likely (and possibly first) is at Turkey, which takes a partner from France, it's worth the risk.

Also, Russia is planning on moving into the Carpathians and Hungary, and Turkey‚Äòs build, in my opinion, can only mean that Turkey is not concerned with Russia, because Turkey‚Äôs right flank is now completely exposed.
If you can provide token assistance to Germany and hold Irish and the channel, then you can probably convoy to the north and push on Russia up there while most of Russia‚Äôs units fight with me. I think this is in our best interests because France dominating the seas isn‚Äôt compatible with England in the long run, and a Turkey Russia alliance is quite difficult to stop.",True,True,austria,england,400,19,Spring,1902,4,0,"austria, england",7

A fleet in Greece is great for attacking Turkey, not so much against Italy.  If we have three fleets against two Italian fleets, we can take him.  Quick. Also, if I‚Äôm in the Black Sea, I can help you against Rumania.

Yeah I‚Äôm totally with you. Russia says he wants a three way victory with me you and him. I think the best thing we can do is build to parity,True,True,germany,italy,1434,52,Winter,1903,5,0,"italy, germany",9

"France is definitely coming for you, but how's this for a tricksy little solution to the issue: 

Currently you are at serious risk of losing Belgium; that sucks, but if you move yourself to Holland you can avoid the destruction of that fleet. Even better though, if you make another move toward the North Sea, I can now *support* that move with Norway, meaning that unless the British successfully predict that, you are in position to take Edinburgh and threaten London unless they pull fleets back; if they pull fleets back, it takes pressure off of me and allows me to forward-deploy my own fleets, which are currently pinned down by British blockade.

Furthermore, you can move your fleet from the Helgoland Bight into Holland to take it, and use Kiel to support Munich to ensure Munich holds for long enough that the British have to disband. There are risks involved in the maneuver of course. The British could not only move themselves to Belgium, but they could move their fleet from the North Sea into Holland, bouncing you out and keeping all of their forces intact despite the loss of the North Sea.",True,True,russia,germany,770,51,Fall,1902,6,1,"germany, russia",9

"So I'll be supporting from Belgium to the North Sea then? There's a further significant risk that the British will use one of their fleets in the north to defeat Norway's support and thus keep the North Sea AND Netherlands AND take Belgium.

Personally, I actually am not a fan of the move. Too many risks to be realistically successful this turn, better saved until next year I think. You're better off using the Helgoland Bight to support Belgium in a retreat to Holland for the time being, and then perform this maneuver next year when your position is more solid and the British have lost a unit. If Munich weren't under enough risk that you could use Kiel to support into Holland as well it would be much more viable.

"Greetings, Germany!

The risk of an early conflict between France and Germany is pretty high, so suggest that we clear the air early on.

The biggest question here is Burgundy, which borders one of your home supply centers and two of mine. It is important to me that Burgundy remains unoccupied - my suggestion is that we set up a bounce between A Munich - Burgundy, A Paris - Burgundy. This has the secondary benefit of allowing us to put on some theater about how the other broke their word to win sympathy points. I also believe that Germany often wants A Munich to stay put anyways, to guard against an attack through Tyrolia.

Let me also know your thoughts regarding Belgium. I am not super attached to claiming it, so would be open to bargain my support on the Belgian question for a future alliance.

Thus you suggest that they do a supported move to the Netherlands using F North Sea and A Ruhr to block that, while you take Belgium.

This will fool them sufficiently that the Germans can use the army in Kiel to support the fleet in Belgium into the Netherlands as well as the fleet in the Bight, ceding Belgium to you in the process, while also freeing me of one necessary support so that I can move from Sweden to Skagerrak, and the British lose two of their units this build phase.

My suggestion is that you open with:
F Edinburgh - Norwegian Sea
F London - North Sea 
A Liverpool - Yorkshire
This guarrenteed you a build in Norway even if Russia moves A Moscow north, while potentially letting you convoy into Belgium. And you can be safe in the knowledge that either A Yorkshire or F North Sea can cover London in the event that I don't keep my word.
