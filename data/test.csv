I'm not going to attack you right now. And despite how difficult it is to predict the future in this game, I honestly don't see myself attacking you in the future either.

Again, I know it's a huge ask, so right now I'm sending MAO south unless you allow me to put it in the channel temporarily.

I don't want you to feel like you are being ignored- but ultimately I decided to make the moves that I thought would be best to help me hold onto what I currently have of Italy. A better way for me to handle things would have been to give you a heads up beforehand (for which I apologize). That being said, we would be having a different conversation had I made an explicit commitment towards moving to Naples. And in terms of results, I think you are actually the greatest beneficiary of the moves from last spring, so there is also that 😂 .",False,True,france,turkey,1210,50,Spring,1905,9,4,"turkey, france",4

I agree that you should defend Greece. Any thoughts on what you want to do about your fleet in Tunis though? Maybe we can organize a swap for Naples?,True,True,france,turkey,1251,55,Winter,1905,12,6,"turkey, france",4

I messed that season up though - had to just let Russia into Sev with his army so he couldn't build there and I could've taken the Black Sea,True,True,turkey,france,1254,58,Winter,1905,6,-6,"turkey, france",4

That is handy. Pretty good overall although he's been quiet lately. He stabbed me but then Russia immediately attacked him so I'm sure we can work something out.,True,True,turkey,france,1257,60,Spring,1906,6,-6,"turkey, france",4
He's angry at me- so not sure how helpful he will be against Russia. I bet Austria will be taking supply centers from me this turn.,False,True,france,turkey,1260,61,Spring,1906,12,6,"turkey, france",4

Up to you guys really. I will probably just try and be a pain for whoever is getting close to the solo by helping the other. I would therefore be happy to take the draw instead.,True,True,turkey,france,1416,72,Fall,1906,6,-6,"turkey, france",4
Looks like you should be able to take it out anyway though. Russia has been playing some sub-par moves so the solo is there for you to take.,True,True,turkey,france,1417,73,Fall,1906,6,-6,"turkey, france",4

What do you mean there's no solo in sight? lol you're on 15 and there are three free centres in England... I might not be paying much attention to this game but I'd have to be blind and dumb not to see that. Even if there weren't freebies there you could get them elsewhere. You'd have to try harder not to solo from here haha,True,True,turkey,france,1432,78,Spring,1907,7,-8,"turkey, france",4

"Regarding the three way, the best way to do it would probably be to force Austria off the map this turn. Maybe Bulgaria-Serbia with support from Rumania while Russia supports Galicia to Budapest?",True,True,france,turkey,1437,80,Spring,1907,15,8,"turkey, france",4

"This game is over, spending more than 2 minutes per season is a waste of time. I'm glad you found the moves interesting though! I cant stop laughing at ""I didn't mean to take Naples"". In my experience, the best way not to take something is to not attack it. That's just what I've found but I guess you've got other methods of not taking something haha, of course you meant to take Naples and of course we both know that this game has been over for a few seasons. It's all the same at this point. Good game, well played. If you're trying to rack up lies with me I wouldn't bother. I have to conclude that that's the only point for all of them the last few seasons or is it just for fun? If its just for fun, carry on, I dont mind. If its for the successful lie counter, Russia is a better option for that I think?",True,True,turkey,france,1518,85,Spring,1907,7,-8,"turkey, france",4
"Well. I was trying to get you to not take Trieste in the fall. I can support it to hold, but I suspect that if you and Russia are coordinating, Vienna would cut Tyrolia's support.",True,False,france,turkey,1520,86,Spring,1907,15,8,"turkey, france",4
